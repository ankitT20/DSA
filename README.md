[Pepcoding DSA - Level 1 | 554 videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-Jc9J83PIiFj7YSPl2ulcpwy-mwj1SSk)  

**I am on a journey to master Data Structures and Algorithms in Java**, while also deepening my understanding of core Java concepts. *This repository contains my daily progress with solutions to problems from Pepcodingâ€™s DSA course. I commit regularly to track my growth and improve problem-solving skills.*  

This repository showcases my journey in learning Java programming through 200 video tutorials. Covering a wide range of topics, from basic data structures and functions to object-oriented programming and stack/queue implementations, I have solved more than 70 questions on key topics such as prime numbers, patterns, arrays, and stacks. Each problem, from basic conditionals to advanced algorithms, has significantly strengthened my understanding of Java and DSA concepts. **This repository reflects my consistent practice and progress toward mastering DSA in Java.**
